# Cope Terminal - Usage Guide

## What is Cope Terminal?

Cope Terminal is a parody, local-only web app that simulates a terminal interface for anonymous confessions, inspired by the culture of pump.fun and crypto trading. Users can submit their "confessions" about trading mishaps, regrets, or degen moments. Each confession is paired with a tongue-in-cheek "therapist" (cope) reply, emphasizing humor and self-awareness.

**All data is stored locally in your browser. Nothing is sent to any server.**

## Main Features

- **Anonymous Confessions:**  
  Use the `confess <your message>` command to submit a confession. Your confession is stored only in your browser.

- **Confession Feed:**  
  View recent confessions (yours and preloaded examples) with the `feed` command. Each confession is followed by a playful "cope" reply.

- **Terminal Experience:**  
  Interact using familiar terminal commands (`help`, `clear`, `about`, etc.) in a PowerShell-inspired interface.

- **Local & Private:**  
  All confessions and data remain on your device. No network or remote storage is used.

## How replies are chosen (local-only)

- The app loads prompts from input.json and snarky responses from output.json (both local files).
- Your confession is matched to the closest prompt using simple word overlap.
- One response is picked at random from that promptâ€™s response list (avoids repeats session-by-session).
- If no good match or files unavailable, a small local fallback is used.
- Nothing is sent to a server; all selection happens in your browser.

## Intended Audience

- Crypto traders, pump.fun users, and anyone who enjoys crypto culture humor.
- Anyone seeking a safe, local, and anonymous way to "cope" with trading stories.
